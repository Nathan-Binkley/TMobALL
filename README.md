## About

During the T-Mobile C2C Hackathon in March 2019, 2 friends and I created a customer service bot for T-Mobile that was able to look up real-time product inventory using a Private API used in the T-Mobile online store.  While creating the project, we noticed that if you called the API endpoint directly it would return actual inventory counts for items in the store, and by slightly modifying the POST request you could view results for multiple stores with a single API call.

TMobAll is an attempt to use this API endpoint to view live inventory information for every T-Mobile store in the United States.
